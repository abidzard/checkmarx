# Checkmarx

Checkmarx is a comprehensive application security platform designed to identify, manage, and mitigate security risks within software applications. It offers a range of tools and solutions to help organizations enhance the security of their software development lifecycle.

## CheckmarxSAST

Checkmarx Static Application Security Testing (Checkmarx SAST) is a specific component of the Checkmarx platform. It focuses on performing static analysis of the source code and binaries of applications. By analyzing the codebase, Checkmarx SAST detects vulnerabilities, security weaknesses, and potential exploits that might exist within the application's source code. This process is performed without actually executing the application.

## CheckmarxSCA

Checkmarx Software Composition Analysis (Checkmarx SCA) is another component of the Checkmarx platform. It is designed to analyze third-party and open-source components used within an application. Checkmarx SCA scans these components for known vulnerabilities, license compliance issues, and any potential risks that might arise from using these components. This helps organizations ensure that their applications do not inherit security vulnerabilities from the components they utilize.

## GitHub Integration
Checkmarx CxSAST supports GitHub Integration enabling the identification of new vulnerabilities with proximity to their creation.
